# Raspberry Pi 5 Home Server

## Before using Raspberry Pi

- I used to use Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ since Q4 2020, it did fine running Discord Bots. Others detail I forgot, its too long.
- Since Mid 2022, I start using Microsoft Azure B2s (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) as my personal VM for Discord Bots and some web application that need backend. For the price of $12.86/month (Inc. VAT) (fyi: I gave my Pi 3 A+ to my friend)
- Once my Azure for Students expired (1 Year later), to prevent my bill from skyrocket, I moved to Contabo VPS (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM) for the price of around ‚Ç¨8-9/month which later reduced to ‚Ç¨4.5/month from Black Friday production
- After using Contabo for half a year. One day, Contabo physical SSD failed and cause my VM to be down. Being unsatisfied of speed and SLA of Contabo, I decided to buy a Raspberry Pi 5.

### Is Raspberry Pi 5 cheaper than Contabo VPS?

At first glance, yes! At second glance, no after I bought too much accessories üíÄ.

But major advantage of Raspberry Pi 5 is that I can use it as a home server, because it's in your home!

## My Setup

- Raspberry Pi 5 8GB RAM
- SSD 250GB (WD Black SN770 via PCIe 3.0 x1)

## What I use Raspberry Pi 5 for?

### Running Docker Container

As of writing this updated blog, there are 31 Docker Containers running

### Hosting Website with Cloudflare Tunnel

No need to worry about not having public IP address, Cloudflare Tunnel can be used
and it is much simpler than configuring nginx.

### Home Project

- [leomotors/home-env](https://github.com/leomotors/home-env) - Moving to On-Premise is
  a huge advantage for this project as ESP32 no longer need to send request to
  other country for metrics and all data is within home's local network

### Backup and GitOps

- [leomotors/honami-backup](https://github.com/leomotors/honami-backup) - Backup files to Blob Storage
- (Private Repo) - Defining Docker Compose with version and _all tokens and api keys_
- [leomotors/honami-gitops](https://github.com/leomotors/honami-gitops) - My custom GitOps

### Plex and Jellyfin

Plex is there for compatibility with cheap chinese TV that is not Android TV

### VPN (WireGuard)

Of course I don't expose Jellyfin or Postgres to internet

## Raspberry Pi 5 (Updated) Guide

Useful stuff you need to know if you are planning to buy Raspberry Pi 5

- Don't install GUI, cause you are going to use it as Home Server. Also Raspbian GUI is cursed.
- Even though Raspbian OS is cursed, it is the only OS that you can update Bootloader from inside.
- Buy Official PSU, it is mandatory for USB Boot or NVMe SSD. Regular PD charger won't work
  as most PD charger only support up to 3A at 5V but Pi 5 needs 5.1V 5A
- WLAN Country Config is buggy in Ubuntu Server, avoid connecting to 5GHz network,
  for best network performance, use LAN cable, it is fast, low latency and more reliable
- You need to change netplan renderer to `NetworkManager`, See: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/change-netplan-renderer-from-networkd-to-networkmanager. Otherwise it might not
  be able to connect to ethernet even you plugged in the LAN cable.
- Buy Micro HDMI to HDMI cable, you ~~might~~ _will_ need it

### Common Mistakes

- Be aware of what you plugged in to USB port, your Pi 5 maybe trying to boot
  from your keyboard üíÄ
